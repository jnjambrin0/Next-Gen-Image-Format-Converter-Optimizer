## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 3.2 Dev Agent Record]

From the extended output format support implementation:

- All processing must happen in sandboxed subprocess for security
- Privacy-aware logging pattern must be followed (no filenames/paths in logs)
- External tools integration pattern established for subprocess execution
- Resource limits and timeouts are enforced for all operations

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ImageConversion]

Content type enumeration already defined:

```python
content_type: Enum - Detected type (photo/illustration/screenshot/document)
```

Need to create new models for detailed classification:

```python
class ContentClassification(BaseModel):
    primary_type: ContentType  # photo/illustration/screenshot/document
    confidence: float  # 0.0-1.0
    secondary_types: Optional[List[Tuple[ContentType, float]]]  # For mixed content
    has_text: bool
    text_regions: Optional[List[BoundingBox]]
    has_faces: bool
    face_regions: Optional[List[BoundingBox]]
    processing_time_ms: float
```

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#QualityMetrics]

Quality metrics that will be enhanced by content detection:

- `visual_quality: Enum - high/medium/low classification`

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#analyze]

Existing /analyze endpoint needs enhancement:

```yaml

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_intelligence_engine.py`
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% minimum
- **Test Pattern**: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Additional test files:

- `backend/tests/unit/test_content_classification.py` - Classification accuracy
- `backend/tests/integration/test_ml_inference.py` - End-to-end ML pipeline
- `backend/tests/performance/test_classification_speed.py` - 500ms requirement

Test considerations:

- Use mock models for unit tests to avoid large model files
- Create minimal test models for integration tests
- Test timeout enforcement and error handling
- Verify privacy-aware operation (no network calls)

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

ML Framework constraints:

- ONNX Runtime 1.16.3 (no TensorFlow/PyTorch dependencies)
- Models must be <50MB for fast loading
- CPU-only inference (no GPU required)
- Cross-platform compatibility required

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

Security constraints:

- All ML inference must validate input sizes to prevent DoS
- Model files must be validated with checksums
- No dynamic model downloading - all models bundled
- Inference timeout enforcement (500ms)

### Implementation Notes

#### Model Integration Architecture

1. **Model Loading**:

   - Load ONNX models at startup (not per-request)
   - Validate model checksums before loading
   - Cache loaded models in memory
   - Graceful fallback if models unavailable

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**:

   - Resize images to MobileNet input size (224x224 or 320x320)
   - Normalize pixel values per model requirements
   - Handle various color spaces (RGB, RGBA, grayscale)
   - Batch multiple regions for efficiency

3. **Inference Optimization**:

   - Use ONNX Runtime execution providers for CPU optimization
   - Implement request batching where possible
   - Cache classification results by image hash
   - Parallel execution for face/text detection

4. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - No cloud API calls - everything local
   - Face regions returned as coordinates only (no extraction)
   - No logging of detection results with identifiable info
   - Models cannot be updated remotely

#### Performance Optimization

To meet the 500ms requirement:

1. Use smaller input sizes for initial classification
2. Run detailed analysis only when needed
3. Implement early-exit for high-confidence classifications
4. Use threading for parallel model execution
5. Pre-allocate inference buffers

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Model loading, preprocessing, individual classifiers
2. **Integration Tests**: Full classification pipeline
3. **Performance Tests**: 500ms timing requirement validation
4. **Accuracy Tests**: Classification accuracy on test dataset

### Test Fixtures

Create test fixtures in `backend/tests/fixtures/ml/`:

- Minimal ONNX models for testing
- Sample images for each content type
- Mixed content test images
- Edge cases (very small, very large, corrupted)
