## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.2 (Preset Management):

- Frontend uses service pattern for API communication
- Components use simple state management without external libraries
- Frontend tests can be marked as low priority if needed
- Proper separation between UI components and API services

### Data Models

No new data models needed - reuse existing conversion result data which already includes file sizes.

### API Specifications

No new API endpoints needed - all comparison happens client-side using already loaded images.

### Component Specifications

Frontend Components to create:

- ComparisonViewer: Simple side-by-side image display with toggle

Integration with existing components:

- Integrate with existing conversion result display
- Reuse existing image display patterns from preview.js
- No new API calls needed

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Files to create/modify:

```
frontend/src/components/
├── comparisonViewer.js # Simple comparison component

frontend/src/app.js     # Modify to integrate comparison view
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Test Location: `frontend/tests/components/` for UI tests
- Framework: Vitest for frontend
- Coverage Requirement: 80% minimum
- Focus on view toggling and responsive behavior

Test files to create:

- `frontend/tests/components/comparisonViewer.test.js`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

- Frontend: Vanilla JS with ES2022 features (no React/Vue)
- CSS: Tailwind CSS for styling
- No backend processing - purely client-side
- Use standard IMG elements for display (simpler than Canvas)
- All features must work completely offline
- Keep it simple - no complex interactions

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

1. No new security concerns - uses already processed images
2. Clear image data from memory when comparison view is closed
3. No logging of image content or filenames

### Processing Engine Integration

No processing engine changes needed - comparison uses already converted images.

### Performance Requirements

- Initial comparison view load < 1 second (images already in memory)
- Smooth view toggling without flicker
- Responsive design transitions should be CSS-based for performance

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Component state, view toggling
2. **Visual Tests**: Correct rendering on different screen sizes
3. **Integration Tests**: Integration with conversion flow

### Test Scenarios

- Toggle between side-by-side and single view
- Display correct file sizes and savings percentage
- Responsive behavior on mobile screens
- Handle images of different aspect ratios
- Verify memory cleanup when view is closed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the Visual Comparison Tools is well-structured and follows the project's architecture patterns. The developer has successfully created a modal-based comparison viewer with responsive design and proper integration with the existing conversion flow. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: frontend/src/components/comparisonViewer.js
  - **Change**: Extracted `formatFileSize` and `calculateSizeReduction` functions to shared utilities
  - **Why**: Code duplication between comparisonViewer.js and conversionResult.js
  - **How**: Moved functions to utils/validators.js and imported them, following DRY principle

- **File**: frontend/src/components/conversionResult.js
  - **Change**: Removed duplicate utility functions and imported from shared module
  - **Why**: Eliminate code duplication and centralize utility functions
  - **How**: Uses the same shared utilities as comparisonViewer for consistency

- **File**: frontend/src/app.js
  - **Change**: Implemented BlobUrlManager for proper memory management
  - **Why**: Prevent memory leaks from orphaned blob URLs
  - **How**: Created a dedicated manager class that tracks and cleans up all blob URLs systematically

- **File**: frontend/src/utils/blobUrlManager.js (created)
  - **Change**: Created new utility class for blob URL lifecycle management
  - **Why**: Centralize memory management and prevent leaks in long-running sessions
  - **How**: Tracks all created URLs and provides methods for cleanup

- **File**: frontend/src/components/comparisonViewer.js
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive accessibility features
  - **Why**: Ensure the component is usable by all users, including those using assistive technologies
  - **How**: Added ARIA attributes, role="dialog", focus management, and keyboard navigation support

- **File**: frontend/src/components/comparisonViewer.js
  - **Change**: Optimized CSS class handling and view update logic
  - **Why**: Improve performance by reducing DOM manipulations
  - **How**: Extracted CSS classes to constants and optimized the updateView function

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows ESLint rules, uses proper ES2022 features
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in frontend/src/components/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage of component functionality
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Extracted duplicate utility functions to shared module (utils/validators.js)
- [x] Implemented proper blob URL memory management (utils/blobUrlManager.js)
- [x] Added comprehensive accessibility features (ARIA attributes, focus management)
- [x] Optimized performance with CSS class constants and efficient DOM updates
- [x] Added unit tests for new BlobUrlManager utility
- [x] Added tests for calculateSizeReduction function

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation:
- Uses existing secure image data from conversion process
- Properly cleans up memory to prevent data leaks
- No network requests or external dependencies
- All processing happens client-side as required

### Performance Considerations

- Modal renders efficiently with minimal DOM manipulations
- CSS class toggling optimized to reduce reflows
- Blob URLs properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- Image loading uses browser's native capabilities
- Responsive design transitions handled via CSS for smooth performance

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation exceeds expectations with excellent code quality, proper testing, and thoughtful architecture. The refactoring improvements enhance maintainability and prevent potential memory issues. The addition of accessibility features ensures the component is usable by all users.
