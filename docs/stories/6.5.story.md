### Architecture Context

#### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#batch-processing-workflow]

**Current Batch Processing:**
- BatchManager already exists in `app/services/batch_service.py`
- Uses asyncio.Queue for work distribution
- WebSocket progress updates already implemented
- Just needs worker pool enhancement

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**libvips Already Integrated:**
- **libvips 8.14.5**: 10x faster than Pillow, streaming ready
- Located in `app/core/processing/vips_ops.py`
- Just needs streaming mode enabled for large files

[Source: CLAUDE.md#batch-processing-architecture-pattern]

**Worker Limits Already Defined:**
```python
# From CLAUDE.md
MAX_BATCH_WORKERS = 10  # Maximum concurrent workers
cpu_count = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
worker_count = max(2, int(cpu_count * 0.8))
worker_count = min(worker_count, MAX_BATCH_WORKERS)
```

#### File Locations (Minimal Changes)

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── batch_service.py    # EXTEND with parallel workers
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── processing/
│   │   │   └── vips_ops.py     # EXTEND with streaming mode
│   │   └── monitoring/
│   │       └── performance.py  # NEW - Simple metrics collector
│   └── cli/
│       └── utils/
│           └── profiler.py     # NEW - CLI profiling flag
```

### Implementation Guidelines

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

**Performance Requirements:**
- "All operations must have timeout and memory limits"
- "All image data must be explicitly cleared after processing"
- Memory safety and resource limits are mandatory

**Security Constraints:**
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Localhost-only CORS policy
- All performance features must respect sandbox constraints

[Source: architecture/security.md#data-protection]

**Privacy Requirements:**
- No persistent image storage (affects caching)
- No PII in performance logs or metrics
- Memory-only processing for privacy

### Technical Specifications

#### Simple Worker Pool Enhancement

```python
# Extend existing BatchManager in batch_service.py
class EnhancedBatchManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.worker_count = min(int(cpu_count() * 0.8), 10)
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(self.worker_count)
        
    async def process_with_workers(self, files: List[Path]):
        async with self.semaphore:
            # Process file using existing conversion pipeline
            result = await self.conversion_service.convert(...)
```

#### Streaming for Large Files

```python
# Extend vips_ops.py
def process_large_image(file_path: str, output_format: str):
    if os.path.getsize(file_path) > 100 * 1024 * 1024:  # >100MB
        # Use libvips streaming
        image = pyvips.Image.new_from_file(file_path, access='sequential')
        # Process in chunks to avoid memory spike
        return image.write_to_buffer(f'.{output_format}')
```

#### Simple Performance Metrics

```python
# New file: app/core/monitoring/performance.py
@dataclass
class ConversionMetrics:
    file_size: int
    processing_time: float
    memory_used: int
    output_size: int
    
    def to_json(self) -> dict:
        return {
            'input_mb': self.file_size / 1024 / 1024,
            'output_mb': self.output_size / 1024 / 1024,
            'time_seconds': self.processing_time,
            'memory_mb': self.memory_used / 1024 / 1024,
            'compression_ratio': self.output_size / self.file_size
        }
```

### Dependencies to Add

```python
# In requirements.txt
psutil>=5.9.0            # For memory monitoring only
# libvips already included
# No other dependencies needed - using existing infrastructure
```

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework:** pytest 7.4.3
**Coverage Goal:** 80% minimum

#### Test Files to Create

- `tests/unit/services/test_batch_parallel.py` - Parallel batch processing
- `tests/unit/core/test_streaming.py` - Large file streaming
- `tests/unit/core/test_performance_metrics.py` - Metrics collection
- `tests/performance/test_worker_scaling.py` - Worker performance (1-10 workers)
- `tests/performance/test_large_files.py` - Memory usage with 100MB-1GB files

#### Performance Benchmarks

- Verify 2-3x speedup with parallel workers on 8-core machine
- Memory usage <500MB for 1GB file processing
- No memory leaks after 100 conversions
- Metrics overhead <1% of processing time

### Security Considerations

- **Worker Isolation**: Maintain existing sandbox per worker
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce existing CLAUDE.md limits (256MB/worker)
- **Metrics Privacy**: No filenames or paths in performance logs

### Integration Points

- **BatchManager**: Add worker pool to existing batch service
- **libvips**: Enable streaming mode for large files
- **WebSocket**: Use existing progress updates for parallel ops
- **CLI**: Add simple --profile flag to existing commands
