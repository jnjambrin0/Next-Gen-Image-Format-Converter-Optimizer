## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.5 implementation:

- API endpoint is available at POST /api/convert
- Accepts multipart/form-data with parameters:
  - file: binary (required)
  - output_format: string (required) - "webp" or "avif"
  - quality: integer (optional) - 1-100, default 85
- Response headers include:
  - Content-Type: image/webp or image/avif
  - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="converted_image.webp"
  - Content-Length: [file_size]
- Error codes use CONV201-CONV299 range
- 50MB file size limit enforced
- 30-second timeout on requests

### Data Models

No specific data models required for frontend implementation. API request/response formats defined above.

### API Specifications

[Source: Story 1.5 - API implementation]

**POST /api/convert**

- Request: multipart/form-data with file, output_format, and optional quality
- Success Response: 200 with binary image data
- Error Responses:
  - 400: Bad Request (invalid parameters)
  - 413: Payload Too Large (file > 50MB)
  - 415: Unsupported Media Type
  - 422: Unprocessable Entity (validation error)
  - 500: Internal Server Error
  - 503: Service Unavailable (at capacity)

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Frontend component locations:

- API service: frontend/src/services/api.js (new)
- Conversion result component: frontend/src/components/conversionResult.js (new)
- Existing components to modify:
  - frontend/src/app.js (main application logic)
  - frontend/src/utils/uiState.js (add new states)
  - frontend/src/components/dropzone.js (update for reset functionality)

### File Locations

Based on project structure:

- New files:
  - frontend/src/services/api.js
  - frontend/src/components/conversionResult.js
- Modified files:
  - frontend/src/app.js
  - frontend/src/utils/uiState.js
  - frontend/src/config/constants.js (add API endpoint)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md - Frontend Testing]

Since specific frontend testing framework not found in architecture docs, follow these general principles:

- Test file naming: _.test.js or _.spec.js
- Unit tests for all new modules
- Mock API calls in tests
- Test error scenarios thoroughly
- Ensure accessibility compliance in UI tests

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- Build tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No external dependencies for core functionality
- All processing happens locally (privacy-first)

### Implementation Notes

1. **File Download**: Use native browser download capabilities via Blob and object URLs
2. **Progress Updates**: Show clear status during upload → conversion → download phases
3. **Error Mapping**: Create user-friendly messages for technical error codes
4. **State Management**: Extend existing UIStateManager with new states
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all new UI elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

Based on existing frontend code patterns:

- Use modular components that can be tested in isolation
- Mock the fetch API for testing API calls
- Test UI state transitions thoroughly
- Verify proper cleanup of resources (object URLs, event listeners)
- Test with various file sizes and formats

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**

1. **Excellent Error Handling**: Comprehensive error mapping with user-friendly messages
2. **Security Conscious**: Proper timeout handling (30s) and resource cleanup
3. **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns (API service, UI state, components)
4. **Type Safety**: Good use of JSDoc annotations for type hints
5. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of object URLs and event listeners

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Missing ConversionResult Component**: Story specifies creating this component but it wasn't implemented
2. **No Retry Functionality**: AC5 mentions retry for failed conversions - not implemented
3. **Limited Progress Granularity**: Only shows phase changes, not actual upload/download progress
4. **Hardcoded Format**: Currently defaults to WebP - no format selection UI

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Test Results:** 46/53 tests passing (87% pass rate)

**Test Quality:**

- ✅ Comprehensive API service tests covering all error scenarios
- ✅ Good timeout and network error coverage
- ✅ Proper mocking of fetch API
- ❌ UI component tests failing due to DOM API issues (DragEvent, DataTransfer)
- ⚠️ XSS prevention tests failing - but code appears to handle sanitization

**Missing Test Coverage:**

- Integration tests for full conversion flow
- Component tests for ConversionResult (component doesn't exist)
- Browser compatibility tests for download functionality

### Security Review

1. **XSS Protection**: ✅ Uses textContent for user input display
2. **CORS Handling**: ✅ Proper proxy configuration
3. **Input Validation**: ✅ File validation before upload
4. **Resource Limits**: ✅ 50MB file size limit enforced
5. **Timeout Protection**: ✅ 30-second timeout on requests

### Performance Observations

1. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of blobs and object URLs
2. **Async Handling**: Correct use of async/await patterns
3. **State Management**: Efficient state transitions without unnecessary re-renders

### Recommendations

**High Priority:**

1. Implement explicit "Convert Another" button instead of auto-reset
2. Create the missing ConversionResult component for better UI organization
3. Add retry functionality for failed conversions
4. Fix failing DOM-related tests with proper test environment setup

**Medium Priority:**

1. Add format selection UI (currently hardcoded to WebP)
2. Implement granular progress tracking (upload %, conversion %, download %)
3. Add integration tests for the complete conversion flow
4. Consider WebSocket implementation for real-time progress

**Low Priority:**

1. Add telemetry for conversion success/failure rates
2. Implement batch conversion UI preparation
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Overall Assessment

**Grade: B+**

The implementation successfully delivers core functionality with excellent error handling and security practices. The main gaps are missing UI components (ConversionResult, retry button) and limited progress granularity. Code quality is high with good separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling. The developer has made pragmatic choices (auto-reset vs button) that work but don't fully match the specification.

**Configuration Note:** Updated vite.config.js to use port 8080 as requested by user.
