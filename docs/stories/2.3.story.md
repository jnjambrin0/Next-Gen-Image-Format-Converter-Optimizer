## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 implementation:

- SecurityEngine fully implemented and orchestrates security operations
- All processing already happens in sandboxed subprocesses
- Privacy-aware logging with structlog is set up
- Security module structure established at backend/app/core/security/
- Metadata handling redesigned to process before conversion (cleaner architecture)

### Data Models

**ProcessSandbox Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ProcessSandbox]
Existing attributes for memory tracking:

- `resource_limits: JSON` - Store memory limits as {"memory_mb": 512}
- `actual_usage: JSON` - Track peak memory usage {"peak_memory_mb": 256}
- `security_violations: Integer` - Count memory limit violations

**ImageConversion Model Updates** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ImageConversion]
May need to add:

- Memory usage metrics to processing_metrics JSON field
- Peak memory consumption tracking

### API Specifications

No specific memory limit parameters found in current API specs. Will need to design appropriate request parameters for memory limits if exposing to API.

### Component Specifications

**Security Engine** [Source: architecture/components.md#Security Engine]
Existing interfaces:

- `create_sandbox(resource_limits) → Sandbox`
- `verify_process_isolation() → IsolationStatus`

**Processing Engine** [Source: architecture/components.md#Processing Engine]
Key consideration: Must integrate with libvips streaming for memory efficiency

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Source Tree]:

New files:

- `backend/app/core/security/memory.py` - Secure memory management implementation

Modified files:

- `backend/app/core/security/sandbox.py` - Add memory limit enforcement
- `backend/app/core/processing/pillow_ops.py` - Secure memory operations
- `backend/app/core/processing/vips_ops.py` - Memory-only configuration
- `backend/app/core/conversion/sandboxed_convert.py` - Memory cleanup
- `backend/app/core/conversion/manager.py` - Memory monitoring integration

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Security Tests]

- Framework: pytest with custom security test suite
- Location: tests/security/
- Coverage: 100% for security modules required
- Environment: Isolated Docker containers for security tests
- Must verify no disk writes, memory clearing, swap prevention

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]

**Critical Security Requirements**:

- Memory Safety: All image data must be explicitly cleared after processing
- Process Isolation: Already enforced via sandboxed subprocess
- Resource Limits: Must enforce memory limits via resource module

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]:

- **subprocess (stdlib)**: For process isolation with resource limits
- **Pillow 10.1.0**: Supports in-memory image operations
- **libvips 8.14.5**: 10x performance with streaming processing (memory-efficient)
- **python-multipart 0.0.6**: Memory-efficient streaming uploads
- **resource module (stdlib)**: For setting memory limits on Unix systems

### Memory Management Approach

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and components.md]

- Use libvips for large images due to 10x performance and streaming capability
- Pillow for broad format support with explicit memory management
- Subprocess isolation already provides memory boundary
- Resource module for enforcing hard memory limits

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security.md#Data Protection]

- No persistent storage of images (memory-only by design)
- Privacy-aware logging (no PII, filenames, or content)
- Process sandboxing provides additional memory isolation

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Test Types and Organization]

- Test file location: `backend/tests/security/test_memory.py`
- Framework: pytest 7.4.3
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Security tests require 100% coverage
- Run security tests in isolated Docker containers
- Create memory stress tests in tests/performance/

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding Implementation** - The secure memory handling implementation demonstrates excellent security engineering practices with comprehensive memory management, proper resource cleanup, and extensive test coverage. The code follows established architectural patterns and maintains high quality standards throughout.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `backend/tests/integration/test_batch_processing.py`

  - **Change**: Added missing import for ImageGenerator
  - **Why**: Test was failing due to NameError
  - **How**: Import allows test to properly generate test images for memory management testing

- **File**: `backend/app/core/security/sandbox.py`
  - **Change**: Removed filename from SecurityError message in sanitize_filename()
  - **Why**: Privacy-aware logging requirement - filenames could contain PII
  - **How**: Changed error message from `f"Invalid filename: {filename}"` to generic `"Filename contains dangerous patterns"`

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Excellent adherence to project patterns
- Project Structure: [✓] All files placed in correct locations per Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: [✓] 100% coverage with 27 comprehensive test cases
- All ACs Met: [✓] All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[✓] All critical improvements handled during review:

- [x] Fixed missing test import
- [x] Enhanced privacy compliance in error messages

### Security Review

**Excellent Security Implementation:**

- 5-pass memory overwrite patterns (0x00, 0xFF, 0xAA, 0x55, 0x00)
- Cross-platform memory locking with graceful fallbacks
- Runtime file system monitoring prevents temp file creation
- Thread-safe memory buffer tracking
- Comprehensive resource limit enforcement

No security concerns found - implementation exceeds security requirements.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-Optimized Implementation:**

- Memory estimation prevents OOM scenarios
- Progressive memory cleanup reduces peak usage
- Format-aware memory multipliers for accurate estimation
- Efficient BytesIO streaming avoids disk I/O

### Architecture Highlights

**Excellent Architectural Decisions:**

- Clean integration with existing SecurityEngine
- Proper separation of concerns (SecureMemoryManager)
- Strictness-based configuration (standard/strict/paranoid)
- Comprehensive error handling with cleanup in all paths
- Privacy-aware structured logging throughout

### Minor Observations

- Test fixture infrastructure issue in batch_processing test unrelated to memory implementation
- Memory fragmentation handling could be enhanced in future iterations (not critical)

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done] - Exceptional implementation of secure memory handling with comprehensive test coverage and security best practices throughout.
