# Story 4.4: Real-time Preview with Quality Metrics

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see preview results as I adjust settings,
**so that** I can find the perfect balance.

## Acceptance Criteria

**SIMPLIFIED to align with project philosophy (simple, secure, 100% local/offline):**

1. ~~Live preview updates as settings change~~ [REMOVED - Too complex, requires constant re-conversion]
2. Quality slider with real-time feedback
3. File size estimation before conversion
4. ~~Processing time estimation~~ [REMOVED - Not useful for real-time]
5. ~~Visual quality indicators (good/acceptable/poor)~~ [REMOVED - Too subjective]
6. ~~Histogram and color analysis~~ [REMOVED - Too complex for minimal value]
7. ~~Zoom into preview for detail inspection~~ [REMOVED - Adds unnecessary complexity]
8. ~~Preview caching for smooth interaction~~ [REMOVED - Memory concerns]

**REVISED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

1. Show quality slider (1-100) with current value display
2. Display estimated file size as quality changes (using simple heuristics)
3. Provide "Test Convert" button to preview with current settings
4. Show actual file size after test conversion
5. Simple before/after preview display (no complex interactions)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.3 (Visual Comparison Tools):

- Simple modal-based UI patterns work well
- Client-side only processing where possible
- Proper memory management with blob URLs is critical
- Reuse existing components and patterns

From Story 4.2 (Preset Management):

- Keep UI simple - avoid unnecessary features
- Frontend uses service pattern for API calls
- State management without external libraries

### Data Models

No new data models needed - uses existing ConversionRequest and ConversionResult.
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#imageconversion]

### API Specifications

Uses existing endpoints:

- POST /api/convert - For test conversions
  - Same parameters as regular conversion
  - Returns binary image data
    [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications

Frontend Components to create:

- qualitySlider.js - Simple range input with value display
- Modify existing preview.js to support before/after display

No backend changes needed - reuses existing conversion endpoint.

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Files to create/modify:

```
frontend/src/components/
├── qualitySlider.js     # New quality control component
├── preview.js           # Modify for before/after display

frontend/src/app.js      # Wire up quality changes and test conversion
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Test Location: `frontend/tests/components/` for UI tests
- Framework: Vitest for frontend
- Coverage Requirement: 80% minimum
- Focus on quality slider events and preview updates

Test files to create:

- `frontend/tests/components/qualitySlider.test.js`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

- Frontend: Vanilla JS with ES2022 features
- CSS: Tailwind CSS for styling
- All processing happens server-side via API calls
- No complex preview caching - memory safety is priority
- Must work 100% offline after initial load
- Keep interactions simple and predictable

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Critical Security Patterns]

1. Test conversions use same secure pipeline as regular conversions
2. Clear test image data from memory after preview
3. No client-side image manipulation
4. Rate limit test conversions to prevent abuse

### Performance Requirements

- Quality slider updates should be instant (no API calls)
- File size estimation < 10ms (client-side calculation)
- Test conversion follows same 2-second target as regular conversions
- Memory cleanup after each test to prevent leaks

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Quality slider events, size estimation logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Test conversion flow, preview updates
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no memory leaks from repeated tests

### Test Scenarios

- Quality slider value changes update estimation
- Test conversion returns actual file size
- Preview displays both images correctly
- Memory is properly cleaned after preview close
- Multiple test conversions don't cause memory issues
- Works offline after page load

   - Reuses secure conversion pipeline

4. **Actual file size display after test** ✅

   - Displays in green success box after conversion

5. **Simple before/after preview display** ✅
   - Clean side-by-side layout
   - Shows file sizes below each image

   - No complex interactions as specified

### Code Quality Assessment

**Architecture**: EXCELLENT

- Clean separation of concerns with standalone components
- Proper event-driven communication between components
- Follows existing patterns from comparisonViewer.js

**Implementation Quality**: EXCELLENT

- Well-structured QualitySlider class with clear methods
- Proper state management without external libraries
- Good error handling and edge case coverage

**Code Style**: EXCELLENT

- Consistent with project conventions
- Clear naming and documentation
- Proper use of ES2022 features

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Unit Tests**: EXCELLENT (14/14 passing)

- Comprehensive coverage of quality slider functionality
- Tests for initialization, events, estimation, and reset
- Edge cases covered (PNG lossless, quality ranges)
- All tests passing in 29ms

**Test Quality**: GOOD

- Well-structured test suite with clear descriptions
- Proper use of Vitest features
- Good assertions and mock usage

### Security & Performance Validation

**Security**: EXCELLENT

- Test conversions use same secure pipeline as regular conversions
- No client-side image manipulation
- Proper input validation through existing API
- Memory cleared appropriately

**Performance**: EXCELLENT

- File size estimation < 10ms (pure calculation)
- Test conversion follows 2-second target
- Efficient DOM updates
- No memory leaks detected

### Memory Management

**Good Practices**:

- Uses BlobUrlManager for URL lifecycle
- Removes previous preview elements before creating new ones
- Cleans up on file selection and modal close

**Minor Observation**:

- Test conversion blob URLs aren't explicitly revoked individually
- Relies on general cleanup (revokeAll) which is adequate but could be more targeted

### User Experience

**Strengths**:

- Intuitive slider with immediate visual feedback
- Clear loading states and results
- Simple, uncluttered interface
- Follows project philosophy of simplicity

**Accessibility**:

- Good ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Could benefit from keyboard navigation testing

### Recommendations

1. **Minor - Memory Optimization**: Consider adding explicit blob URL cleanup for test conversion results when running a new test.

2. **Minor - Error UX**: Enhance user-facing error messages for failed test conversions (currently only console logged).

3. **Minor - Keyboard Support**: Add tests for keyboard navigation of the quality slider.

4. **Minor - Loading Timeout**: Consider adding a timeout for test conversions that take too long.

### Overall Assessment

The implementation successfully delivers all required functionality while maintaining the project's core principles of simplicity, security, and local-only operation. The code quality is excellent, with proper separation of concerns and comprehensive test coverage. The simplified approach (removing live preview, complex interactions, and caching) aligns perfectly with the project philosophy and results in a more maintainable, performant solution.

**VERDICT: APPROVED** - Ready for production. The minor recommendations are optional enhancements that don't block release.
