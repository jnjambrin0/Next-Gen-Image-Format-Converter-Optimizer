### Data Models

**ConversionRequest Model:**

```python
- file: UploadFile - The image file to convert
- output_format: str - Target format (webp, avif)
- quality: Optional[int] = 85 - Quality setting (1-100)
```

**ConversionResponse Headers:**

```
Content-Type: image/webp or image/avif
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="converted_image.webp"
Content-Length: [file_size]
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

**POST /api/convert**

- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Request Body:
  - file: binary (required) - Image file
  - output_format: string (required) - "webp" or "avif"
  - quality: integer (optional) - 1-100, default 85
- Responses:
  - 200: Binary image data with appropriate headers
  - 400: Bad Request (invalid parameters)
  - 413: Payload Too Large (file > 50MB)
  - 415: Unsupported Media Type
  - 422: Unprocessable Entity (validation error)
  - 500: Internal Server Error
  - 503: Service Unavailable (at capacity)

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/components.md#api-gateway-fastapi-application]

**API Gateway (FastAPI Application)**

- Responsibility: HTTP request handling, routing, and response formatting
- Dependencies: ConversionManager from Story 1.4
- Technology Stack: FastAPI, python-multipart for file handling

### File Locations

Based on architecture source tree [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

- API routes: backend/app/api/routes/conversion.py (new)
- Service layer: backend/app/services/conversion_service.py (new)
- Request models: backend/app/models/requests.py (new)
- Response models: backend/app/models/responses.py (new)
- Tests: backend/tests/unit/ and backend/tests/integration/

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Test framework: pytest 7.4.3
- Test file convention: test\_[module_name].py
- Coverage requirement: 80% minimum
- Integration tests should use real image files from fixtures
- Test concurrent requests using asyncio

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Python version: 3.11+ required
- FastAPI version: 0.104.1
- python-multipart: 0.0.6 (for file uploads)
- Max file size: 50MB (configurable)
- Request timeout: 30 seconds
- Max concurrent conversions: 10 (configurable)

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

- Use CONV201-CONV299 range for API-specific errors
- All errors must include correlation ID
- Log all conversion attempts with timing

### Implementation Notes

1. **File Handling**: Use UploadFile.read() to get bytes, don't save to disk
2. **Streaming**: For large files, consider streaming response in future
3. **Validation**: Validate actual file content, not just extension
4. **Concurrency**: Use asyncio.Semaphore for request limiting
5. **Monitoring**: Log request size, processing time, and output size

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Test file location: tests/unit/ and tests/integration/
- Use httpx.AsyncClient for API testing
- Mock ConversionManager for unit tests
- Use real conversion for integration tests
- Test edge cases: empty files, corrupted files, huge files
