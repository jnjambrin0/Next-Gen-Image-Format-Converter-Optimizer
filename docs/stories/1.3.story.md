## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 completion:

- FastAPI backend is running on port 8000 with CORS configured for localhost development
- Static file serving is set up for production mode at backend/app/main.py
- API endpoints are prefixed with /api (important for future integration)
- Health check available at /api/health for testing connectivity

### Data Models

No specific data models required for this story. This is purely frontend UI implementation.

### API Specifications

API integration not required for this story, but future stories will use:

- POST /api/convert endpoint for image conversion [Source: architecture/components.md#api-gateway-fastapi-application]

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Frontend Build: Vite 5.0.0
- UI Framework: Vanilla JS (ES2022)
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS 3.3.5
- Icons: Lucide 0.294.0 (for future icon needs)

**UI Design Requirements** [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]

- Primary interaction: Drag-and-drop first
- Clean, minimalist design emphasizing transparency and trust
- Brand colors: primary blue (#0066CC), success green (#00AA44)
- Typography: Inter font for UI elements
- Target: Desktop web browsers (1280px and up) primary, tablets secondary

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

- Main entry: frontend/src/main.js (exists, needs update)
- Dropzone component: frontend/src/components/dropzone.js (needs creation)
- Utilities: frontend/src/utils/validators.js (needs creation)
- Styles: frontend/src/styles/main.css (exists, contains Tailwind imports)
- HTML entry: frontend/index.html (exists, needs update)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
Frontend testing approach to be established, but following general principles:

- Test framework: To be determined (suggest Vitest for Vite compatibility)
- Coverage requirement: 80% minimum
- Test location: frontend/tests/
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- JavaScript: ES2022 standard
- Style: Prettier for JS formatting
- Naming: camelCase for JS modules and functions
- Critical: Interface must support no-network operation
- All operations must work offline once loaded

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

Since frontend testing framework is not specified in architecture, recommend:

- Use Vitest (integrates well with Vite)
- Test file location: frontend/tests/
- Test file naming: test.[component].js or [component].test.js
- Mock browser APIs for drag-and-drop testing
- Use Testing Library utilities for accessibility testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid frontend development practices with a clean, modular architecture. The drag-and-drop functionality is well-implemented with proper event handling and accessibility support. The code follows the project's architectural guidelines and uses vanilla JavaScript as specified.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: frontend/src/components/dropzone.js
  - **Change**: Added import for UIStates
  - **Why**: Missing import was causing reference error when error handling triggered
  - **How**: Added proper import statement at the top of the file

- **File**: frontend/src/components/dropzone.js
  - **Change**: Added throttling to dragover events and proper cleanup
  - **Why**: Improve performance during drag operations and prevent memory leaks
  - **How**: Applied throttle utility to dragover handler, added destroy method with proper event listener cleanup

- **File**: frontend/src/components/loadingSpinner.js
  - **Change**: Replaced innerHTML with DOM manipulation
  - **Why**: Security best practice to avoid potential XSS vulnerabilities
  - **How**: Created elements using document.createElement and proper DOM APIs

- **File**: frontend/src/components/appLayout.js (new)
  - **Change**: Extracted app layout from inline HTML string
  - **Why**: Avoid large innerHTML usage and improve maintainability
  - **How**: Created modular functions that build DOM elements programmatically

- **File**: frontend/src/app.js
  - **Change**: Replaced innerHTML template with DOM component
  - **Why**: Security and maintainability - avoid large HTML strings
  - **How**: Now imports and uses createAppLayout function

- **File**: frontend/tests/unit/dropzone.test.js
  - **Change**: Added tests for destroy method
  - **Why**: Ensure proper cleanup functionality is tested
  - **How**: Added test suite verifying event listener removal and reference cleanup

- **File**: frontend/tests/unit/uiMessages.test.js
  - **Change**: Removed unused import
  - **Why**: ESLint error - beforeEach was imported but not used
  - **How**: Removed beforeEach from the import statement

- **File**: frontend/package.json
  - **Change**: Updated Vitest to version 3.2.4
  - **Why**: Previous version 2.2.3 didn't exist
  - **How**: Updated to latest stable version 3.2.4

### Compliance Check

- ESLint: ✓ All linting issues resolved, code properly formatted

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed missing UIStates import in dropzone component
- [x] Added performance throttling for drag events
- [x] Implemented proper event listener cleanup with destroy method
- [x] Removed all innerHTML usage for better security

### Security Review

- All innerHTML usage has been removed and replaced with secure DOM APIs
- File validation properly implemented with MIME type checking
- XSS protection enhanced through proper text node creation
- Event handler cleanup prevents memory leaks
- File size limits enforced (50MB max)

### Performance Considerations

- Drag events now throttled (100ms) for better performance
- Proper cleanup methods prevent memory accumulation
- DOM manipulation optimized by creating elements programmatically
- No unnecessary re-renders or DOM thrashing observed

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation meets all requirements with high code quality. The refactoring significantly improved security by eliminating innerHTML usage, enhanced performance with event throttling, and added proper resource cleanup. All code now passes linting standards.
