### Implementation Guidelines

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Code Standards:**

- Python 3.11+ with type hints required
- Black formatter for code style
- Snake_case for functions/modules
- PascalCase for classes
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Explicit exception handling

**CRITICAL Security Requirements:**

- **Privacy-First**: NO storage of filenames, paths, or any PII in autocomplete/history
- **Command Sanitization**: Strip all file paths before storing in learning data
- **Path Validation**: Use existing PathSanitizer for ALL file operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply RateLimiter to watch mode (max 10 events/second)
- **Resource Limits**: Watch mode max 100 files, max 5 concurrent conversions
- **Macro Security**: Validate and sandbox ALL macro commands before execution
- **Shell Injection Prevention**: Use shlex.quote() for all shell parameters
- **Memory Safety**: Enforce 512MB limit for watch mode queue
- **DoS Prevention**: Auto-shutdown on resource exhaustion
- **File Permissions**: All config files must be 600 (user read/write only)

**Testing Requirements:**

- pytest 7.4.3 framework
- 80% minimum coverage
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test files in `backend/tests/unit/cli/productivity/`

### Integration Points

**With Existing CLI (Story 6.1 & 6.2):**

- Extend CLIConfig for profiles
- Use existing theme system for output
- Leverage Rich console for formatting
- Build on existing history module
- Use TUI components for interactive features

**With SDK (Story 5.3):**

- Maintain SDK client patterns
- Use temp files for image data
- Follow existing error handling

**With Security Features:**

- Use PathSanitizer for all file paths
- Apply RateLimiter to watch mode
- Follow sandboxing patterns for conversions

### Offline/Local Operation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: ALL features MUST work 100% offline with NO network connectivity:

- **Autocomplete**: Learning data stored locally only, no cloud sync
- **History**: All history data remains local, no telemetry
- **Profiles**: No profile sharing via network, only local import/export
- **Watch Mode**: Local filesystem monitoring only
- **Macros**: No remote macro repositories or sharing
- **Shell Integration**: No downloading of completion scripts from internet
- **All Operations**: Must work in air-gapped environments

### Technical Specifications

#### Watch Mode Implementation

[Source: Architecture patterns + watchdog library]

```python
# Use watchdog library for cross-platform file monitoring
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

# Debouncing for rapid changes (e.g., 500ms delay)
# Queue-based processing with configurable concurrency
# Filter patterns: include/exclude globs
```

#### Fuzzy Search Algorithm

```python
# Use rapidfuzz library for performance
from rapidfuzz import fuzz, process

# Score threshold: 60% for matches
# Search in: command, parameters, timestamp
# Interactive selection with arrow keys
```

#### Profile Schema

```json
{
  "name": "web-optimized",
  "description": "Optimized for web delivery",
  "parent": null, // or parent profile name
  "settings": {
    "output_format": "webp",
    "quality": 85,
    "max_width": 1920,
    "strip_metadata": true
  },
  "overrides": {
    // Command-specific overrides
  }
}
```

### Dependencies to Add

```python
# In requirements.txt
watchdog>=3.0.0      # File system monitoring
rapidfuzz>=3.0.0     # Fuzzy string matching
pyyaml>=6.0          # YAML output format
# CSV is in standard library
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with strong security-first design principles. The story successfully delivers all 8 acceptance criteria with comprehensive privacy protection, resource management, and security controls. The 220+ test methods provide thorough coverage across unit, integration, and security testing. The code demonstrates mature architectural patterns with proper separation of concerns and defensive programming practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: backend/app/cli/productivity/autocomplete.py

  - **Change**: Enhanced file permission setting for encryption key
  - **Why**: Original implementation used touch(mode=0o600) followed by open() which could reset permissions
  - **How**: Added explicit chmod after file write using stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR to ensure 0o600 permissions persist

- **File**: backend/app/cli/productivity/watcher.py

  - **Change**: Completed ResourceMonitor implementation with auto-shutdown
  - **Why**: Original implementation lacked proper consecutive violation tracking and detailed logging
  - **How**: Added violation counter, configurable threshold (3 violations), and detailed error logging before shutdown

- **File**: backend/app/cli/productivity/macros.py

  - **Change**: Implemented SignatureVerifier class with HMAC-based signing
  - **Why**: Class was referenced in tests but not implemented, critical for macro integrity
  - **How**: Added complete HMAC-SHA256 implementation with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks

- **File**: backend/app/cli/productivity/shell_integration.py

  - **Change**: Added PowerShell execution policy warnings and guidance
  - **Why**: Users need clear guidance on PowerShell security settings to use completions
  - **How**: Added comprehensive comments explaining Set-ExecutionPolicy requirements and security implications

- **File**: backend/app/cli/commands/watch.py
  - **Change**: Improved SDK import error handling with user-friendly messages
  - **Why**: Silent failures made debugging difficult for users
  - **How**: Added SDK availability check, specific error messages, and installation instructions at startup

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All Python code uses type hints, snake_case naming, async patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct module organization under cli/productivity/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ AAA pattern, comprehensive mocking, exceeds 80% coverage
