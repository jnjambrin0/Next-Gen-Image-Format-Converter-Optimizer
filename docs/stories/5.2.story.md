## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 5.1 implementation:
- Authentication patterns already exist for WebSocket tokens (can reuse for API keys)
- Rate limiting infrastructure is mature with token bucket algorithm
- Middleware patterns well-established for request processing
- Privacy-aware logging patterns must be strictly followed
- Validation middleware intercepts requests before FastAPI

### Authentication Infrastructure

**Existing WebSocket Authentication** [Source: backend/app/api/websockets/secure_progress.py]:
- Token-based authentication with SHA-256 hashing
- 24-hour token expiration with automatic cleanup
- Token generation and verification patterns
- Rate limiting: 10 connections/minute/IP

**Authentication Requirements** [Source: architecture/security.md#Authentication & Authorization]:
- Optional API key authentication for local API access
- Stateless API design (no sessions)
- API keys stored hashed in SQLite
- Rate limiting per API key supported

### Database Schema

**Required API Key Table** (following existing patterns):
```sql
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- UUID
    key_hash TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,    -- SHA-256 hash
    name TEXT,                        -- Optional key name
    permissions TEXT,                 -- JSON permissions
    rate_limit_override INTEGER,      -- Custom rate limit
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_used_at TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE api_usage_stats (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    api_key_id TEXT,
    endpoint TEXT NOT NULL,
    method TEXT NOT NULL,
    status_code INTEGER,
    response_time_ms INTEGER,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (api_key_id) REFERENCES api_keys(id)
);
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration

**Current Implementation** [Source: backend/app/core/security/rate_limiter.py]:
- Token bucket algorithm with minute/hour buckets
- Default: 60 requests/minute, 1000 requests/hour
- Configurable via settings

**Enhancement Requirements**:
- Extend SecurityEventRateLimiter to check API key limits
- Add rate limit headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
- Support custom limits per API key

### Middleware Integration

**Existing Middleware** [Source: backend/app/api/middleware/]:
- Error handler middleware
- Logging middleware (privacy-compliant)
- Validation middleware (rate limiting)

**Integration Points**:
- Add authentication dependency to FastAPI routes
- Integrate with existing validation middleware
- Maintain request processing order

### CORS Configuration

**Current Setup** [Source: backend/app/config.py]:
```python
cors_origins: Union[str, List[str]] = Field(
    default="http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000",
    description="Allowed CORS origins",
)
```

**Requirements** [Source: architecture/security.md#API Security]:
- Localhost only, no external origins
- Configurable for development environments

### Privacy-Aware Logging

**Critical Requirements** [Source: CLAUDE.md#Privacy-Aware Logging Pattern]:
- NEVER log filenames, paths, or user content
- Use generic error messages
- Log only metadata (method, status, duration)
- Hash API key identifiers in logs

**Example Pattern**:
```python
# CORRECT
logger.info("API request processed", 
    method="POST", 
    path="/api/v1/convert",
    status=200,
    duration_ms=150,
    api_key_hash=hash_api_key(api_key)[:8])

# WRONG
logger.info(f"Converting file {filename} for API key {api_key}")
```

### Security Patterns

**Error Categories** [Source: CLAUDE.md#Simplified Error System]:
- Use only: `network`, `sandbox`, `rate_limit`, `verification`, `file`
- For auth errors, use `verification` category

**Architecture Constraints** [Source: CLAUDE.md#Architecture Constraint]:
- LOCAL-ONLY application
- No distributed features or external services
- All processing offline
- No telemetry
