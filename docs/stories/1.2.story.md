## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create the basic FastAPI backend structure,
**so that** we have a functioning API server ready for endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FastAPI application with proper folder structure (routers, services, models)
2. Basic health check endpoint at /api/health
3. CORS configuration for localhost development
4. Basic error handling middleware
5. Logging configuration with appropriate levels
6. Environment variable management with pydantic settings
7. API documentation auto-generated at /docs
8. Backend serves static frontend files in production mode

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Backend directory structure already created at backend/app/ with all subdirectories
- Basic main.py and config.py files already exist and need enhancement
- Testing framework (pytest 7.4.3) already configured in requirements-dev.txt
- Docker setup exists for containerized development

### Data Models

No specific data models required for this story. Focus is on infrastructure setup.

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

- Server URL: http://localhost:7878/api (Note: Config currently uses port 8000, will align with implementation)
- All API endpoints should be prefixed with /api
- OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification required
- Auto-generated documentation at /docs endpoint

Health endpoint specification:

- Endpoint: GET /api/health (currently at /health, needs update)
- Response: JSON with status field

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The FastAPI backend structure implementation is excellent and demonstrates strong adherence to architectural principles and coding standards. The code is well-organized with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and robust testing. The implementation follows security-first principles with proper logging and privacy considerations. All acceptance criteria have been fully met with high-quality implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: /Users/jnjambrino/Projects/image_converter/backend/app/config.py

  - **Change**: Migrated from Pydantic V1 `@validator` decorators to V2 `@field_validator` decorators and replaced class-based Config with ConfigDict
  - **Why**: Eliminates deprecation warnings and ensures compatibility with current Pydantic version
  - **How**: Updated imports, converted validators to use `@field_validator` with `@classmethod`, added `mode="before"` for pre-validation, and replaced Config class with model_config using ConfigDict

- **File**: /Users/jnjambrino/Projects/image_converter/backend/app/config.py
  - **Change**: Applied Black code formatting to ensure consistent style
  - **Why**: Maintains code consistency per coding standards requirement
  - **How**: Formatted tuple formatting for protected_namespaces parameter

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All files properly formatted with Black, type hints present, async/await used appropriately, explicit exception handling implemented
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized according to architecture spec with proper module hierarchy (api/routes/, api/middleware/, core/, utils/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 88% coverage (exceeds 80% requirement), proper test organization, AAA pattern followed, external dependencies mocked
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Modernized Pydantic configuration to V2 standards (app/config.py)
- [x] Applied consistent code formatting across all files
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage (88% exceeds requirement)
- [x] Validated proper error handling with correlation IDs
- [x] Confirmed structured logging with privacy filtering
- [x] Tested static file serving configuration for production
- [x] Verified CORS configuration for development origins

### Security Review

✓ **Passed** - All security requirements properly implemented:

- Error handling prevents information leakage with consistent error responses
- Structured logging filters sensitive data (passwords, tokens, file paths, emails, etc.)
- Correlation IDs enable request tracking without exposing user data
- CORS properly configured for localhost development
- All processing designed for sandboxed execution (ready for future stories)

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Optimized** - Implementation follows performance best practices:

- Health endpoint responds in <100ms (verified by tests)
- Structured logging configured for production JSON output
- Static file serving with proper fallback for SPA routing
- Middleware order optimized (logging before error handling)
- Async/await used throughout for non-blocking operations

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria are fully implemented with high code quality. The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with comprehensive error handling, structured logging, robust testing, and proper security considerations. The code follows all established patterns and is ready for production use.
