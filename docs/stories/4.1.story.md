## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.5 (Advanced Optimization):

- Singleton service pattern used - services initialized in main.py during lifespan startup
- Semaphore pattern for concurrent request limiting (used asyncio.Semaphore)
- Global timeout pattern at API level using asyncio.wait_for
- Memory management pattern - explicitly clear references to prevent leaks
- Input validation must include upper bounds to prevent DoS

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ImageConversion]

Existing ImageConversion model can track individual batch items:

```python
class ImageConversion(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    status: Literal["pending", "processing", "completed", "failed"]
    processing_time: float  # seconds
    error_message: Optional[str]
    created_at: datetime
```

Need to create new BatchJob model:

```python
class BatchJob(BaseModel):
    job_id: UUID
    total_files: int
    completed_files: int
    failed_files: int
    status: Literal["pending", "processing", "completed", "cancelled"]
    settings: Dict[str, Any]  # Batch-wide conversion settings
    created_at: datetime
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#paths]

Batch endpoint specification:

```yaml
/batch:
  post:
    summary: Convert multiple images
    requestBody:
      content:
        multipart/form-data:

            schema:
              properties:
                job_id: string
                total_files: integer
                status_url: string

          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/BatchJobStatus"
```

WebSocket endpoint for progress:

- Path: /ws/batch/{job_id}
- Message format: `{"file_index": 0, "filename": "...", "status": "processing", "progress": 45}`

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#batch-processing-workflow]

Batch Processing Workflow:

1. User drops multiple files in UI
2. API receives POST request to /api/batch endpoint
3. Conversion Manager creates job queue
4. Queue Manager assigns each image to Worker Pool
5. Workers process images in parallel (respecting sandbox requirements)
6. Progress updates sent via WebSocket to UI
7. Batch results compiled and returned as downloadable ZIP

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_batch/`, `backend/tests/integration/test_batch_api.py`
- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% minimum
- **Performance Tests Required**: Batch processing must handle 100 files efficiently

Test files to create:

- `backend/tests/unit/test_batch/test_manager.py`
- `backend/tests/unit/test_batch/test_worker.py`
- `backend/tests/unit/test_batch/test_results.py`
- `backend/tests/integration/test_batch_api.py`
- `backend/tests/integration/test_websocket_progress.py`
- `backend/tests/performance/test_batch_performance.py`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

- **Concurrency**: Use Python's asyncio with FastAPI's async support
- **Process Isolation**: Each image MUST process in sandboxed subprocess
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce CPU, memory, and time limits per conversion
- **Worker Pool**: Scale based on CPU cores (multiprocessing.cpu_count())
- **File Upload**: Use python-multipart for streaming multipart uploads
- **Memory Management**: Stream large files, clear buffers after processing
- **No Logging PII**: Never log filenames, paths, or image content
- **Network Isolation**: All processing must work offline

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

1. Each file in batch MUST run in separate sandboxed subprocess
2. Validate total batch size to prevent DoS (e.g., 100 files \* 50MB = 5GB max)
3. Implement per-job resource quotas
4. Clean up temporary files immediately after processing
5. Rate limit batch submissions per IP
6. Validate file types before processing

### Database Schema

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

New table for batch jobs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE batch_jobs (
    job_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_files INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completed_files INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    failed_files INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    settings TEXT,  -- JSON
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    user_ip TEXT  -- For rate limiting
);

CREATE TABLE batch_job_files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    job_id TEXT REFERENCES batch_jobs(job_id),
    file_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Original filename for display only
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT,
    processing_time REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Queue management, worker pool, result compilation
2. **Integration Tests**: Full batch pipeline with multiple files
3. **WebSocket Tests**: Real-time progress updates
4. **Performance Tests**: 100-file batch processing under 3 minutes
5. **Security Tests**: Resource limits, sandbox isolation for batch

### Test Scenarios

- Happy path: 10 files, all succeed
- Mixed results: Some files succeed, some fail
- Cancellation: Cancel individual files and entire batch
- Resource limits: Ensure memory/CPU limits enforced
- WebSocket: Connection drops and reconnects
- Large batch: 100 files of various sizes

## QA Results

### QA Review Date: 2025-08-04

**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Review Type**: In-Progress Feature Review (Backend Components Only)

### Executive Summary

The batch processing backend implementation shows strong architectural thinking and good code structure, but has critical integration issues that prevent it from functioning properly. The implementation is approximately 60% complete for backend components, with all frontend tasks still pending.

### Updated QA Review - Post-Fix Assessment

**Review Date**: 2025-08-04 (Updated)
**Review Type**: Post-Fix Verification

### Executive Summary - Updated

The development team has successfully addressed all critical issues identified in the initial review. The batch processing backend is now functionally complete with robust security features. Backend implementation has progressed from ~60% to ~95% complete.

### 🟢 Critical Issues Resolution Status

All critical issues have been successfully resolved in version 1.3:

1. **Service-Manager Interface Mismatch** ✅ FIXED

   - Added all missing methods to BatchManager (lines 431-602)
   - Implemented complete interface: `is_cancelled()`, `is_item_cancelled()`, `update_file_status()`, `get_progress()`, `complete_job()`, `update_job_status()`, `get_job_results()`, `cleanup_job_results()`
   - All methods properly tested and integrated

2. **API Route Storage Problem** ✅ FIXED

   - Removed undefined global references from tests
   - Tests now use proper mocking patterns
   - API routes properly integrated with BatchManager's internal storage

3. **Architectural Anti-Pattern** ✅ FIXED

   - BatchService refactored to properly delegate to BatchManager
   - Clean separation of concerns achieved
   - Service layer now only orchestrates, manager handles execution

4. **Incomplete Data Flow** ✅ FIXED
   - Added `_job_results` storage in BatchManager (line 63)
   - Modified `_process_task()` to store converted image data (lines 237-245)
   - Connected result storage to BatchResultCollector for ZIP generation
   - Download endpoint verified to return actual converted files

### 🟢 Security Enhancement Status

All security concerns have been comprehensively addressed:

1. **WebSocket Security** ✅ ENHANCED

   - Implemented comprehensive token-based authentication system
   - Added SecureConnectionManager with SHA-256 token hashing
   - 24-hour token expiration with automatic cleanup
   - Rate limiting: 10 connections per minute per IP
   - Maximum 10 concurrent connections per job
   - New endpoint for token refresh: `POST /api/batch/{job_id}/websocket-token`
   - Backward compatible with `batch_websocket_auth_enabled` setting

2. **Resource Tracking** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

   - Batch processing inherits existing per-file sandboxing
   - Each file processed in isolated subprocess (verified in code)
   - Recommendation: Add explicit resource metrics collection per file

3. **Error Isolation** ✅ VERIFIED
   - Error isolation properly implemented in `_process_task()`
   - One file's failure doesn't stop batch (lines 252-261)
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper status updates
   - Integration tests verify error scenarios

### 🟢 Implementation Strengths
