## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 3.3 Dev Agent Record]

From the content-aware detection implementation:

- IntelligenceEngine already classifies content types (photo/illustration/screenshot/document)
- Cascade architecture with QuickClassifier and MLClassifier provides fast classification
- Comprehensive feature extraction available: entropy, edge detection, color analysis, UI patterns
- Content-specific optimization recommendations already partially implemented
- Privacy-aware logging patterns must be maintained

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ImageConversion]

Existing content_type field can be leveraged:

```python
content_type: Enum - Detected type (photo/illustration/screenshot/document)
```

Need to create new models for recommendations:

```python
class FormatRecommendation(BaseModel):
    format: OutputFormat  # webp/avif/jpeg-xl/heif/png/jpeg/webp2/jpeg2000
    score: float  # 0.0-1.0 recommendation strength
    reasons: List[str]  # Human-readable reasons
    estimated_size_kb: int  # Predicted output size
    quality_score: float  # Predicted quality (0-1)
    compatibility_score: float  # Browser/device support
    features: Dict[str, bool]  # transparency, hdr, animation support
    trade_offs: Dict[str, str]  # size vs quality analysis

class RecommendationRequest(BaseModel):
    content_classification: ContentClassification  # From story 3.3
    use_case: Optional[UseCaseType]  # web/print/archive
    original_format: InputFormat
    original_size_kb: int
    prioritize: Optional[str]  # size/quality/compatibility
```

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#UserPreset]

Can extend UserPreset to store format preferences:

```python
settings: JSON - Complete conversion parameters  # Can include format preferences
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#analyze]

Existing /analyze endpoint currently returns basic recommendations. Need new endpoint:

```yaml
/intelligence/recommend:
  post:
    summary: Get intelligent format recommendations
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              content_type:
                type: string
                enum: [photo, illustration, screenshot, document]
              use_case:
                type: string
                enum: [web, print, archive]
              original_format:
                type: string

              items:
                type: object
                properties:
                  format:
                    type: string
                  score:
                    type: number
                  reasons:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      type: string
                  estimated_size_kb:
                    type: integer
                  quality_score:
                    type: number
                  trade_offs:
                    type: object
            comparison_matrix:
              type: object
```

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/components.md#Intelligence Engine]

Intelligence Engine needs extension:

- Existing: `classify_content()`, `recommend_settings()`
- New: `recommend_format(content_type, use_case, original_format) → List[FormatRecommendation]`

The RecommendationEngine will be part of Intelligence Engine module.

### File Locations

- All operations must work offline

### Implementation Notes

#### Recommendation Algorithm Architecture

1. **Multi-Factor Scoring System**:

   - Content type compatibility (40% weight)
   - Use case optimization (30% weight)
   - Source format compatibility (20% weight)
   - User preferences (10% weight)

2. **Format Characteristics Matrix**:

   ```python
   FORMAT_CHARACTERISTICS = {
       "webp": {
           "compression": "excellent",
           "browser_support": "good",
           "features": ["transparency", "animation"],
           "best_for": ["web", "general"],
           "quality_range": (0.7, 0.95)
       },
       "avif": {
           "compression": "best",
           "browser_support": "moderate",
           "features": ["transparency", "hdr"],
           "best_for": ["web", "photography"],
           "quality_range": (0.6, 0.9)
       },
       # ... other formats
   }
   ```

3. **Use Case Profiles**:

   - **Web**: Prioritize compression, browser support
   - **Print**: Prioritize quality, color accuracy
   - **Archive**: Prioritize lossless, future compatibility

4. **Learning System**:
   - Track: content_type → chosen_format mappings
   - Weight recent choices higher
   - Cap preference influence at 10% to prevent bias
   - Store anonymized data only (no filenames/paths)

#### Performance Optimization

- Cache format characteristics in memory
- Pre-compute compatibility matrices
- Use numpy for fast scoring calculations
- Limit recommendations to top 3 for performance

## Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Scoring algorithms, format analysis, preference storage
2. **Integration Tests**: Full recommendation pipeline with IntelligenceEngine
3. **Performance Tests**: <200ms recommendation generation
4. **Privacy Tests**: Ensure no PII in preferences

### Test Fixtures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent architecture and meets all acceptance criteria. The multi-factor recommendation engine is well-designed with comprehensive format analysis and privacy-aware preference tracking.

**Strengths:**

- Well-structured multi-factor recommendation engine with configurable weights
- Comprehensive format characteristics matrix with 8 output formats
- Privacy-aware user preference tracking with SQLite storage
- Excellent separation of concerns between engine, service, and API layers
- Strong caching strategy with TTL and size limits
- Comprehensive test coverage across unit and integration tests

**Critical Issues Found and Fixed:**

#### 1. Missing Service Initialization (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** The recommendation_service was not initialized in main.py, causing the API endpoints to fail
**Fix Applied:** Added proper initialization in main.py startup lifecycle

```python
# Initialize recommendation service (CRITICAL: Must be initialized for Story 3.4)
from .services.recommendation_service import recommendation_service as rec_service_import, RecommendationService
import app.services.recommendation_service as rec_module
rec_module.recommendation_service = RecommendationService()
```

**Impact:** Prevents runtime failures when accessing recommendation endpoints

#### 2. API Input Validation Enhancement (HIGH)

**Issue:** Missing upper bound validation on file size could allow DoS attacks
**Fixes Applied:**

- Added max size limit: `original_size_kb: int = Body(..., gt=0, le=102400, description="Original file size in KB (max 100MB)")`
- Added regex validation for prioritize field: `regex="^(size|quality|compatibility)$"`
  **Impact:** Prevents resource exhaustion from oversized requests

### Security Assessment

✅ **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation at both API and engine levels

- API validates size bounds (0 < size ≤ 100MB)
- Engine validates request types and data integrity
- Proper error messages without exposing PII

✅ **Concurrency Protection:** Well-implemented semaphore pattern

- MAX_CONCURRENT_RECOMMENDATIONS = 10
- Proper async context manager usage
- Class-level semaphore initialization

✅ **Cache Security:** Correctly implemented deep copy pattern

- `copy.deepcopy(cached_response)` prevents cache poisoning
- TTL-based cache expiration (5 minutes)
- Size-limited cache with cleanup strategy

✅ **Privacy Compliance:** All logging is privacy-aware

- No filenames, paths, or user data in logs
- Generic error messages
- Anonymized preference tracking

### Performance Verification

✅ **<200ms Requirement:** Met with efficient caching

- Score caching reduces repeated calculations
- Parallel format scoring with asyncio.gather
- Early cache hit returns

✅ **Concurrent Request Handling:** Properly limited to 10

- Semaphore protection prevents resource exhaustion
- Graceful degradation under load

✅ **Memory Management:** Efficient with bounded caches
