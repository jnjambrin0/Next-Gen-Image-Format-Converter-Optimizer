# Story 2.4: Privacy-Focused Logging and Monitoring

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** privacy-conscious user,
**I want** minimal logging that respects my privacy,
**so that** my activities aren't tracked or stored.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No logging of file names or paths
2. No logging of image content or metadata
3. Only aggregate statistics (format types, sizes)
4. Logs rotate and auto-delete after 24 hours
5. Option to disable all logging ("paranoia mode")
6. No external analytics or telemetry
7. Local-only error reporting
8. Clear documentation of what is/isn't logged

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.3 implementation:
- Privacy-aware logging already enforced in security modules
- Structured logging with structlog is configured and working
- SecurityError messages already follow privacy guidelines (no filenames)
- Logging uses stderr to avoid stdout contamination

From Story 2.2:
- Metadata removal already logs privacy-safe summaries
- Security audit logging foundation exists

From Story 2.1:
- security_events table already created for security monitoring
- ProcessSandbox tracks security violations without PII

### Data Models

**Security Events Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Already exists with schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE security_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'violation', 'scan', 'sandbox_create'
    severity TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'info', 'warning', 'critical'
    details TEXT,  -- JSON (must be privacy-safe)
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**ProcessSandbox Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ProcessSandbox]
Existing model for tracking sandbox events without PII:
- `resource_limits: JSON`
- `actual_usage: JSON`
- `security_violations: Integer`

### API Specifications

No current API specs for logging/monitoring endpoints. Need to design:
- `GET /api/stats` - Aggregate statistics (privacy-safe)
- `GET /api/logging/config` - Current logging configuration
- `PUT /api/logging/paranoia` - Toggle paranoia mode
- `GET /api/errors/report` - Aggregate error report

### Component Specifications

**Existing Logging Module** [Source: backend/app/utils/logging.py]
Already implements:
- `filter_sensitive_data()` - Removes PII from logs
- `add_correlation_id()` - Adds request correlation
- structlog configuration with privacy processors
- JSON structured output

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- **structlog 23.2.0**: Privacy-aware logging, structured output
- **SQLite**: Local database for security events

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

New files:
- `backend/app/core/monitoring/stats.py` - StatsCollector implementation
- `backend/app/core/monitoring/errors.py` - ErrorReporter implementation
- `backend/app/api/routes/monitoring.py` - Monitoring API endpoints
- `docs/logging-privacy-guide.md` - Comprehensive logging documentation

Modified files:
- `backend/app/utils/logging.py` - Enhanced privacy filtering
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add paranoia mode configuration
- `backend/app/main.py` - Add log rotation setup
- `backend/app/db/repositories/security.py` - Enhanced security event methods

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Testing Philosophy]

- **Framework**: pytest 7.4.3
- **Coverage Goal**: 100% for security/privacy modules
- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/core/test_logging.py`
- **Security Tests**: `backend/tests/security/test_privacy_logging.py`

Testing focus:
- Privacy filter effectiveness
- Log rotation behavior
- Paranoia mode functionality
- Network isolation verification
- Aggregate statistics accuracy

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]

**Critical Privacy Rules**:
- **No Logging PII**: Never log filenames, paths, or image content
- **Privacy-Aware Errors**: Generic messages without revealing user data
- **Local-Only**: No external services or telemetry

**Logging Standards** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Standards]:
- Library: structlog 23.2.0
- Format: JSON structured logs
- Levels: DEBUG (dev only), INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Required Context: Correlation ID, Service Context (no user info)

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security.md#Data Protection]
- **Logging Restrictions**: No filenames, paths, or content
- **Local Processing**: All logs stay on user's machine
- **Audit Trail**: Security events for monitoring (privacy-compliant)

### Implementation Notes

1. Build on existing structlog configuration
2. Extend filter_sensitive_data() for comprehensive PII removal
3. Use SQLite for any persistent logging (security events only)
4. Implement in-memory stats collection for performance
5. Ensure paranoia mode completely disables disk logging
6. All error messages must be generic (no user data)
