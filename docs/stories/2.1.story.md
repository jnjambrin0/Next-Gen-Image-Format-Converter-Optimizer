# Story 2.1: Process Sandboxing Implementation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** security-conscious user,
**I want** all image processing to happen in sandboxed processes,
**so that** potential vulnerabilities cannot affect my system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each conversion runs in isolated subprocess with restricted permissions
2. Subprocess has no network access
3. Subprocess has limited filesystem access (read input, write output only)
4. Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory, time)
5. Proper cleanup of subprocess resources after completion
6. Graceful handling of subprocess crashes
7. Security audit log for monitoring (local only)
8. Configuration for sandbox strictness levels

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.6 implementation:
- Basic conversion API is working at POST /api/convert
- Image processing currently happens in main process (not sandboxed)
- Need to maintain same API interface while adding sandbox layer
- Current timeout is 30 seconds - this should be enforced at sandbox level

### Data Models

**ProcessSandbox Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ProcessSandbox]
Purpose: Tracks sandboxed process execution for security

Key Attributes:
- `process_id: String` - System process identifier
- `conversion_id: UUID` - Related conversion
- `resource_limits: JSON` - CPU/memory/time limits
- `actual_usage: JSON` - Actual resource consumption
- `security_violations: Integer` - Attempted violations
- `start_time: DateTime` - Process start
- `end_time: Optional[DateTime]` - Process completion

Relationships: One-to-one with ImageConversion

### API Specifications

No API changes required - sandboxing is internal to backend processing.

### Component Specifications

**Security Engine Interfaces** [Source: architecture/components.md#Security Engine]
Required methods:
- `create_sandbox(resource_limits) → Sandbox`
- `scan_file(input_file) → SecurityReport`
- `strip_metadata(image_data) → CleanedImage`
- `verify_process_isolation() → IsolationStatus`

Dependencies: OS-level subprocess module, resource limits
Technology: subprocess with restricted permissions, resource module for limits

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Source Tree]:

New files:
- `backend/app/core/security/sandbox.py` - Main sandbox implementation
- `backend/app/models/process_sandbox.py` - ProcessSandbox model
- `backend/tests/security/test_sandbox.py` - Security tests

Modified files:
- `backend/app/core/security/engine.py` - Integrate sandbox
- `backend/app/core/conversion_manager.py` - Use sandboxed processes
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Add sandbox configuration

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Security Tests]

- Framework: pytest with custom security test suite
- Location: tests/security/
- Scope: Sandbox escapes, resource limits, metadata stripping
- Environment: Isolated Docker containers
- Coverage: 100% for security modules
- Use Bandit for SAST scanning of security code

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]

**Critical Security Requirements**:
- Process Isolation: Every image conversion MUST run in a sandboxed subprocess
- Memory Safety: All image data must be explicitly cleared after processing
- No Logging PII: Never log filenames, paths, or image content
- Network Isolation: Code must function with no network connectivity
- Resource Limits: All operations must have timeout and memory limits

**Python Standards**:
- Python 3.11+ required
- Type hints required for all functions
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- snake_case for functions and modules
- Explicit exception handling, no bare except

### Implementation Notes

**Security Sandbox Workflow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Security Sandbox Workflow]

1. Conversion Manager requests `create_sandbox(limits)`
2. Security Engine forks process via OS
3. Apply restrictions: No Network, Limited FS, Resource Caps
4. Execute conversion in sandboxed process
5. Handle outcomes:
   - Success: Return serialized result
   - Security Violation: Kill process, return security error
   - Timeout: Kill process, return timeout error
6. Cleanup resources

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Process Control: `subprocess` (Python stdlib)
- Resource Monitoring: `resource` module
- Logging: structlog 23.2.0 for privacy-aware structured logging

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Python Specifics]

- Test file naming: test_*.py
- Test class naming: TestClassName
- Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 100% coverage on security modules
- Security tests must run in Docker containers
- Never use real image files in tests

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- Multi-layered security with command validation, path sanitization, and environment isolation
- Comprehensive resource limits enforced at OS level
- Process group isolation for proper cleanup
- Privacy-aware audit logging (no PII in logs)
- Graceful handling of security violations with tracking
- Network isolation and filesystem restrictions
- Support for different strictness levels with appropriate resource limits

**Implementation Highlights:**
- SecuritySandbox class handles low-level process isolation
- SecurityEngine orchestrates all security operations
- ProcessSandbox model tracks execution metrics and violations
- Full integration with ConversionManager for transparent sandboxing
- Fallback to direct conversion if sandboxing is disabled

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient resource tracking via /proc filesystem
- Minimal overhead from sandboxing (measured in tests)
- Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Configurable timeouts and limits per strictness level
- Concurrent sandbox execution properly isolated

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Outstanding Achievement:**
The developer has delivered a production-ready sandboxing implementation that exceeds the original requirements. The code demonstrates deep understanding of security principles with proper defense-in-depth strategies. The test coverage is exceptional with both positive and negative test cases covering all security scenarios.

**Particularly Impressive:**
1. The privacy-aware audit logging that strips all sensitive information
2. Resource usage tracking with actual metrics collection
3. Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases like fork bombs and concurrent execution
4. Clean separation of concerns between SecuritySandbox, SecurityEngine, and ProcessSandbox
5. Thoughtful configuration system with three strictness levels

This is exemplary work that can serve as a reference implementation for secure subprocess execution.
