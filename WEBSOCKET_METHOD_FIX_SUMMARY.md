# WebSocket Method Name Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The batch processing was failing with `TypeError: websocketService.onMessage is not a function` because the frontend code was calling a non-existent method.

## Root Cause
- **Method Mismatch**: The WebSocketService class has a method called `on()` for registering message handlers
- **Wrong Usage**: The app.js code was trying to call `onMessage()` which doesn't exist
- **Secondary Error**: When the WebSocket setup failed, error handling crashed because `errorElement` could be null

## Solution Applied

### Frontend Changes
In `frontend/src/app.js`:

1. **Fixed method calls** (lines 270, 278):
   ```javascript
   // Before: websocketService.onMessage('progress', ...)
   // After:  websocketService.on('progress', ...)
   ```

2. **Added null check** (lines 312-316):
   ```javascript
   const errorElement = document.getElementById('errorMessage')
   if (errorElement) {
     // ... error display code ...
   }
   ```

## How It Works Now
1. WebSocket service is created when batch starts
2. Message handlers are registered using the correct `on()` method
3. Progress updates and completion notifications are received
4. Batch summary modal appears with download options
5. Error handling doesn't crash if DOM element is missing

## Testing
Created `test_websocket_fix.js` to verify:
- WebSocketService has correct methods
- No JavaScript errors occur
- WebSocket messages are received properly
- Batch processing completes successfully

## Result
âœ… Batch processing now works completely from file selection to download!
