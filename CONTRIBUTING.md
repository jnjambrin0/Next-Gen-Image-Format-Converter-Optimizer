pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Run the backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

pytest                     # All tests
pytest tests/unit/        # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/ # Integration tests

```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

1. **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8
2. **Formatting**: Use Black formatter
   ```bash
   black backend/
   ```
3. **Type Hints**: Required for all functions
   ```python
   def convert_image(
       input_data: bytes,
       output_format: str,
       quality: int = 85
   ) -> Tuple[bytes, ConversionResult]:
       """Convert image to specified format.
       
       Args:
           input_data: Raw image bytes
           output_format: Target format (webp, avif, etc.)
           quality: Output quality (1-100)
           
       Returns:
           Tuple of converted bytes and result metadata
       """
   ```
4. **Docstrings**: Use Google style
5. **Imports**: Sort with isort
   ```bash
   isort backend/
   ```

### JavaScript (Frontend)

1. **Style Guide**: ESLint with Prettier
2. **Formatting**: 
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```
3. **Linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
4. **Component Structure**:
   ```javascript
   // Use functional components with clear naming
   export function ImageUploader({ onUpload, maxSize }) {
       // Component logic
   }
   ```

### Security Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Always follow these security practices:

1. **Never log PII**: No filenames, paths, or user data in logs
2. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate before processing
3. **Use sandboxing**: All image processing must be sandboxed
4. **Memory management**: Clear sensitive data with secure patterns
5. **Path validation**: Prevent directory traversal attacks

Example of secure error handling:
```python
# CORRECT: Generic error without PII
logger.error("File processing failed: invalid format")

# WRONG: Exposes user data
logger.error(f"Failed to process {filename}")  # Never do this!
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **New features**: Must have >80% test coverage
- **Bug fixes**: Must include regression tests
- **Security features**: Must have comprehensive security tests

### Writing Tests

#### Python Tests
```python
import pytest
from app.core.conversion import convert_image

def test_webp_conversion():
    """Test JPEG to WebP conversion."""
    # Arrange
    with open("tests/fixtures/sample.jpg", "rb") as f:
        input_data = f.read()
    
    # Act
    result, output = convert_image(
        input_data,
        output_format="webp",
        quality=85
    )
    
    # Assert
    assert result.success
    assert result.output_format == "webp"
    assert len(output) > 0
```

#### JavaScript Tests
```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { validateImageSize } from '../utils/validation';

describe('Image Validation', () => {
    it('should reject oversized images', () => {
        const result = validateImageSize(100 * 1024 * 1024); // 100MB
        expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
        expect(result.error).toContain('size');
    });
});
```
