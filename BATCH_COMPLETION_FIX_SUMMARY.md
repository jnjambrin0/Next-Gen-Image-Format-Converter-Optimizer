# Batch Processing Completion Notification Fix

## Issue Fixed
The batch processing was completing successfully on the backend, but users couldn't download the converted files because the frontend never received notification that the job was complete.

## Root Cause
The `BatchManager._check_job_completion()` method was not sending a WebSocket notification when the job finished. It was only updating the database, so the frontend's WebSocket connection never received the completion message.

## Solution Applied

### Backend Changes
In `backend/app/core/batch/manager.py`:

1. Added import:
   ```python
   from app.api.websockets import send_job_status_update
   ```

2. Added WebSocket notification in `_check_job_completion()` method (line 416):
   ```python
   # Send WebSocket notification about job completion
   asyncio.create_task(send_job_status_update(job.job_id, job.status))
   ```

### Frontend Cleanup
In `frontend/src/app.js`:
- Removed unused 'job_complete' message handler (lines 278-281)
- Frontend already correctly listens for 'job_status' messages with status 'completed'

## How It Works Now
1. When batch processing completes, `BatchManager._check_job_completion()` is called
2. It updates the database AND sends a WebSocket notification
3. Frontend receives 'job_status' message with status 'completed'
4. Frontend shows the batch summary modal with download options
5. Users can download their converted files

## Testing
Created `test_batch_completion_fix.js` to verify:
- WebSocket messages are received
- Summary modal appears after completion
- Download button is available

## Result
âœ… Users can now download their batch-converted files after processing completes!
